[Hello, Wrold!](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396) I'm Taq, Senior Software Engineer at [Intersection](https://twitter.com/intersection_co). I'm also an Adjunct Professor at King's College, where I teach an intro to web devleopment class. [I've taught Front-end Web Development at GA 14x](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/10-lessons-learned-from-100-weeks-of-teaching-fewd-12c43db14f6b) (so far). Currently, I'm teaching a remote Javascript Development class (also at GA) - my second foray into the world of remote instruction. In the past, I've taught some form of coding at institutions such as [C4Q](https://www.c4q.nyc/), [The Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/), [NYCDA](https://nycda.com/), [One Month](https://onemonth.com/) and [Columbia Splash](https://columbia.learningu.org/). When I'm not working I am usually [thinking about math](https://medium.com/math-musings/why-does-25-25-2-2-1-100-25-an-explanation-6c7e7b283d41), [building](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/a-technique-for-saving-content-from-a-data-text-html-uri-10f045a8876d) [software](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/introducing-bonfire-2c0e437895e2), or [working](https://photos.app.goo.gl/w1crzgI7DqCgGR373) [on](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EaFkp5SmyO0opkg32) [hardware](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tvxPl2zbIMl7FEnK2) [hacks](https://www.instagram.com/p/8rARZNND_t/?taken-by=taqqui.karim).
